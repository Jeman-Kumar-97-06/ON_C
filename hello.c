// ...such as functions, variables, macros and data types that are shared across multiple source files in a project.
// 'stdio.h' file here, is a header file with standard input / output functions.

#include <stdio.h>

//'main()' function is the entry point of every 'c' program. it's where the main shit happens. 'int main()' means ...
// ... the function returns an integer.
int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
